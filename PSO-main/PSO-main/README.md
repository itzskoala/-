# PSO Examples

- pso.py = implementation of PSO to find the global minima in a sigmoid function.
- PsoForSchwefel.py = implementation of PSO to find the global minima in Schwefel function.
- PsoForAckley.py = implementation of PSO to find the global minima in Ackley function.
- PsoForCluster.py = implementation of PSO to find the centroid for Class A, B, C, and D.
- Generate4Cluster2Ddataset.py = program to generate a .csv file of 2D dataset of 4 Class.
- 4Cluster2Ddataset.csv = the .csv file that I have been using with 5000 rows.
- MultipleSwarmPSO.py = Program that implements Multiple Swarm PSO, a variation of PSO that can have multiple swarming groups maintaining multiple Gbest values and hence for the classification problem to find the centroid of data points that belong to A, B, C, and D. The dataset need not be split and PSO need not be run 4 times for data points that belong to each class.
